  Secureum is a working prototype of an anonymous insurance service. The idea
  was to create a simple and secure way to protect yourself against flight
  delays or extreme weather conditions. We used Ethereum based smart contracts
  to automate the validation of payouts and prevent the leakage of personal
  information. All you need is an Ethereum Wallet ID and 20 seconds of your time
  to go through a full insurance process. A working version of the service is
  currently not online.
