  The age assessment is a complicated procedure used to determine the
  chronological age of an individual who lacks legal documentation. While there
  is no method that provides an exact identification of the age, current
  practices require high amounts of manual work and invasive X-ray imaging.
  Previous publications show that the status of growth plates in the knee could
  be an appropriate indicator for the border to adulthood. As part of a DFG
  study, noninvasive MRI recordings were collected to investigate this
  hypothesis further. This thesis provides a step towards a solution by fully
  automating the extraction of bone in knee MRIs using convolutional neural
  networks to reduce the data complexity. These results show a dice similarity
  coefficient of 98% when compared to the manually labeled ground truth and
  further improve the work of previous studies. This thesis concludes with a
  proof of concept estimating the age of individuals using the generated bone
  segmentations. The preliminary results show the potential of this approach
  achieving a mean difference of 0.48 ± 0.32 years.

The age assessment is a complicated procedure used to determine the chronological age of an individual who lacks legal documentation. While there is no method that provides an exact identification of the age, current practices require high amounts of manual work and invasive X-ray imaging. Previous publications show that the status of growth plates in the knee could be an appropriate indicator for the border to adulthood. As part of a [DFG][0] study, noninvasive MRI recordings were collected to investigate this hypothesis further. This thesis provides a step towards a solution by fully automating the extraction of bone in knee MRIs using convolutional neural networks to reduce the data complexity. These results show a dice similarity coefficient of 98% when compared to the manually labeled ground truth and further improve the work of previous studies. This thesis concludes with a proof of concept estimating the age of individuals using the generated bone segmentations.

The code of the project and the full thesis will we available soon.
