  Setting a new state of the art on ImageNet Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (
  SENets) introduce a building block for CNNs that improves channel
  interdependencies at almost no computational cost. They were used at this
  years ImageNet competition and helped to improve the result from last year by
  25%.
